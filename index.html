        <h1>Little About Tigray</h1>
        <div class="text">
          Found in the Eastern highlands Africa, Tigray is steeped in rich
          history and cultural heritage, often celebrated as a land of origins.
          This area is not only known for its stunning landscapes but also as
          the cradle of the Axumite Kingdom, one of the most powerful
          civilizations in ancient Africa which was named one of the biggest
          civilizations alongside with Egypt, Roma, and Persia. Axum was not
          only a center of trade but also a melting pot of cultures. It was one
          of the first states in sub-Saharan Africa to mint its own coins and
          adopt Christianity as the state religion around 350 CE, making it a
          pivotal player in early Christian history12. The influence of Axum
          extended to various regions, facilitating trade routes that connected
          it with distant lands like India and Rome. This cultural exchange
          enriched its society, leading to advancements in art, architecture,
          and governance.
